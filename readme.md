## How to run the project

Compiling the project requires the **rust toolchain**. If you don't already have rust, installation is platform dependent but very straightforward. See [rust's guide](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) for steps. Once the toolchain is ready to go, you should have `cargo` as a command, and running the project is very simple from there:

- Run `cargo run --release` to compile and run in **release mode** (higher fps, optimized)
- Run `cargo run` to compile and run in **debug mode** (lower FPS, logs)

I would recommend release mode unless you are curious to see logging statements as the system runs.

### Usage guide

One you have the program running, there are a few binds to be aware of...
