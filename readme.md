# Voxel engine

## Notes for grading

Easiest way to navigate for grading is the simple **showcase keybinds**, which are numkeys 1, 2, etc:

1. Numkey 1: showcases water bobbing, shadows visible, and sinwave terrain gen
2. Numkey 2: showcases a more realistic terrain, sunset transition happening
3. Numkey 3: showcases more powerful 3D terrain capabilities (proving that terrain is not a mere heightmap) with 3D simplex noise!
4. Numkey 4: showcases a wider terrain with clearer biomes
5. Numkey 5: showcases some beach scenery
6. Numkey 6: showcases a mini badlands biome

### Important usage warnings/notes

1. UI is EXPENSIVE and may cause lag so be weary of that.
2. Shadows have very low render distance of 32 voxels (have not implemented cascaded shadow maps)

### Cool things I'm proud of (things to pay attention to)

#### Graphics stuff

1. "Vertex pulling." Each group of 6 vertices that make up a face share a **single 32 bit uint** in a GPU buffer. This required cool GPU stuff and unpacking face data in shaders (packing on CPU of course). The shader code where this data is unpacked is seen [here](./assets/shaders/world/lib/face_unpacking.wesl) if you are curious about what/how data is packed into a single uint.
2. Global illumination via the "sun" with directional lighting, and a shadow pass that adds basic hard-shadows using shadow mapping.
3. Approximate **ambient occlusion** based on nearby voxels to a vertex. Provides some depth to the world even where there is no lighting.
4. Full transparency support via a separate render pass.
5. Custom UI implementation (with `taffy` for computing flexbox layouts and `glyphon` for text heavylifting)
6. Custom fog and sky shaders that define the sky and horizon blending with sun/moon.
7. Convenient texture and voxel definition loading enabling swapping voxel textures easily in the `assets/blocks` folder.
8. Water vertices "wave" up and down if you look at them closely!

#### Other stuff

1. Chunk loading uses multi-threaded compute pooling
2. ECS architecture for data-oriented design of the entire system
3. Rendering and simulation run in parallel (only with a max of 1-frame delta though)

### AI usage

1. AI wrote the texture converter in [tools/texture_processor](./tools/texture_processor.rs) (though some adjustments and fixes were made) to add tints to existing pngs and generate a water clear texture.
2. AI helped with determinance of some thresholds regarding biomes that are typical of other voxel engines, and while it was a good baseline, I definitely need to tune the thresholds.
3. AI helped with writing the makefile to work fully on ubuntu without root access since I don't have access to a ubuntu machine.

### Time spent

Not exactly sure but a lot, likely greater than 100 hours

## How to run the project

On most Linux distros, simply running `make` should work (since a bundled version of rust has been included locally)

Otherwise...

Compiling the project requires **Rust 1.88 or newer**.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have Rust, check out [the official guide](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) for installing it.
>
> - Assuming `rustup` is being used (eg, from the official guide above), the project's `rust-toolchain.toml` will automatically handle versioning to match 1.88.
> - Any other installation method will have to manually ensure the version 1.88 or newer.

To run, `cargo` can be used like any standard Rust project:

- Run `cargo run --release` to compile and run in **release mode** (higher fps, optimized compilation)
- Run `cargo run` to compile and run in **debug mode** (lower FPS, debug tracing, simplified compilation)

## Acknowledgments

The "biggest" dependencies this project relies on are...

1. `winit` for an abstraction layer on creating and managing OS windows and events
2. `wgpu` for an abstraction layer on communicating with the gpu and ultimately rendering the graphics
3. `wesl` as a `wgsl` preprocessor, enabling import statements in shaders and other QOL features
4. `glyphon` for handling text rendering (with a glyph atlas), font loading, and vectorization (using underlying `cosmic-text`)
5. `bevy_ecs` for a framework to implement the entity component system the simulation relies on
6. `taffy` for computing UI layouts, particularly flex-box set ups, given a set of input styles.
7. `noise` (rust library) for providing a very simple Simplex noise interface to use in generation.

A full list of dependencies with exact version can be seen in the [cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml).
